# About

The default countdown to the timer is 30 seconds. The timer will only start when you hit the play button. It will pause on the pause button and resume counting down again when you hit the play button once more.

When paused, you can change the number to a higher or lower figure. The timer stops when it hits 0.

Watch the circumference of the circle disappers as the timer counts down to 0.

I completed this project to practise my Javascript skills.
