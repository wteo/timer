# About

The default countdown to the timer is 30 seconds. The timer will only start when you hit the play button. It will pause on the pause button and resume on the play button.

When paused, you can change the number to a higher or lower figure. The timer stops when it hits 0. 

Watch the circumference of the circle disappers as the timer counts down to 0.

To reset the timer, simply refresh the web page.

This project is based on the Udemy Course I am currently enrolled, "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course", section 20, (https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/) which I completed to practise my Javascript skill.
